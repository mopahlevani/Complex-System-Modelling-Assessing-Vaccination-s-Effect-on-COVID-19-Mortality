# NetLogo-Projects
NetLogo is an agent-based modeling environment used to model complex systems and structures. 
My first project using NetLogo Version 6.2 was done by July 2021 as a project for the "Introduction to Complex Systems and Structures" Course.
This was a simple model to test whether the Vaccination Rate and Vaccination Commence Date are effective enough to help "Flatten the Curve" or not; Then, if it was effective, the modeling could help to estimate how effective it is.
