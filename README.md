Complex Systems Modeling: Assessing Vaccination's Effect on Pandemy's Mortality

This repository contains an agent-based model exploring epidemic dynamics using NetLogo. Developed as part of the Introduction to Complex Systems course, the model investigates the impact of vaccination strategies on managing a pandemic.

The project focuses on:
- The effect of vaccination start date on controlling the spread of an epidemic.
- The impact of vaccination rate on "flattening the curve."
- The model is inspired by real-world challenges observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Features:
- Simulates the spread of an epidemic in a population.
- Explores the effectiveness of different vaccination strategies in mitigating outbreaks.
- Provides visualizations and outcomes to estimate the impact of vaccination policies.

This project is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates the application of agent-based modeling in epidemiology.
